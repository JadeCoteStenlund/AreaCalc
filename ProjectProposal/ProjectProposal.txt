Project Proposal

1. Short project description
This software is designed to get the area for a variety of different shapes. A list of available shapes will be displayed and entering the associated number will bring up a few fields to be filled in as to the dimensions of the shape. The program will then generate the area based on these measurements.

2. Software requirements
There are only limited software requirements. It requires a windows operating system and windows .net 4.5.1 and will perform on almost any hardware set. The main feature of the application is its ability to calulate the area of a shape given the dimensions.

3. Baselines
