Project Proposal

1. Short project description
This software is designed to get the area for a variety of different shapes. A list of available shapes will be displayed and entering the associated number will bring up a few fields to be filled in as to the dimensions of the shape. The program will then generate the area based on these measurements.
2. Software requirements
